# Koko Analytics

Open-source, self-hosted and privacy-friendly website analytics.

This repository is a ported version of the [Koko Analytics plugin for WordPress](https://www.kokoanalytics.com/), but built on top of Symfony framework.

This project is still in development and a stable version has not yet been released. We expect to be able to release our first stable version in Q2 of 2025.
